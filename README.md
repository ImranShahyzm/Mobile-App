I am in the field of programming since last 5 years. I am not a full time programmer and adopted it as my current job position needs it. 
VB 6 was the first IDE encountered by me and my journy starts. Fall in love with Microsoft IDE and this continue until Visual Studion 2017 with C#, MVC and SQL Server 2015
